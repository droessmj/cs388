1. I have Ubuntu installed already for Ruby on Rails dev on my personal laptop, and for the BSD version I just went with FreeBSD. I didn't 
choose it for any particular reason at all, other than the fact that you mentioned some major companies that currently use it.
	1. I've been using Ubuntu on and off for about 3 years, and I understand the background behind making a very user friendly distribution. 
	Generally, I'm pretty comfortable using the package manager within Ubuntu.
	For FreeBSD, I know nothing at all. It took me 3 attempts to just install the image and create a user, and to then log in with that 
	user.  Up to this point, it seems to be a pretty straightforward Unix like OS. I guess I don't have enough experience with various
	Unix OS's to love or hate any specific features of a given OS.  Personally, I enjoy Ubuntu because it has Unix under the hood, but
	it still is familar and comfortable.
