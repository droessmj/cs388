1. I have Ubuntu installed already for Ruby on Rails dev on my personal laptop, and for the BSD version I just went with FreeBSD. I didn't 
choose it for any particular reason at all, other than the fact that you mentioned some major companies that currently use it.
	1. I've been using Ubuntu on and off for about 3 years, and I understand the background behind making a very user friendly distribution. 
	Generally, I'm pretty comfortable using the package manager within Ubuntu.
	For FreeBSD, I know nothing at all. It took me 3 attempts to just install the image and create a user, and to then log in with that 
	user.  Up to this point, it seems to be a pretty straightforward Unix like OS. I guess I don't have enough experience with various
	Unix OS's to love or hate any specific features of a given OS.  Personally, I enjoy Ubuntu because it has Unix under the hood, but
	it still is familar and comfortable.

	4. I've tried to use Ubuntu as my everyday OS a few times, but there are always games or features that Windows/OS X have that bring 
	me back, namely Netflix and League of Legends. While it is possible to get these working on Ubuntu, at the end of the day it is easier
	to keep a partition with Windows. This gradually turns into booting into Windows by default and Ubuntu for dev specific tasks. For 
	the FreeBSD, I understand that it is good for servers. So I would suppose that I could use it to host my own server. I'm not sure what 
	else I even could use it for.

	1.Ubuntu - Comes with a bunch of graphical programs, but not everything under the hood. No git, vim out of the box.
