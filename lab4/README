Could not get script 1 to handle random symbols for removal. It came down to an inability to escape the //
characters without overly escaping the regex...if that makes sense. Otherwise, everything else should
work as intended and handle incorrect arguments.

I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed this lab. It seemed very practical, and I was really forced
to learn a good deal of things that I believe will be of use in the future.  Of all the labs thus far, 
I learned more in this one than in the rest of them combined.
