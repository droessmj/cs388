Middleman takes in a command and named pipe. Any input to the named piped is then read into the command in middleman.

Usage:
mkfifo fifo
./middleman -c bash -f fifo
echo * > fifo

imv takes in a list of files. File names are then editable in $EDITOR. File names are then changed
to match any modifications made within the program.

Usage:
./imv *
