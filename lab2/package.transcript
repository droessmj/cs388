*************************** GITWEB *************************************
If you installed the GITWEB option please follow these instructions:

In the directory /usr/local/share/examples/git/gitweb you can find all files to
make gitweb work as a public repository on the web.

All you have to do to make gitweb work is:
1) Copy the files /usr/local/share/examples/git/gitweb/* to a directory on
   your web server (e.g. Apache2) in which you are able to execute
   CGI-scripts.
2) In gitweb.cgi, adjust the variable $projectroot to point to
   your git repository (that is where you have your *.git project
   directories).

*************************** CONTRIB ************************************
If you installed the CONTRIB option please note that the scripts are
installed in /usr/local/share/git-core/contrib. Some of them require
other ports to be installed (perl, python, etc), which you may need to
install manually.
